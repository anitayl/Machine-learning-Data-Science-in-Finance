# Machine-learning-Data Science in Finance
##Goal
This is a Wharton capstone project that cooperates with Estimize, a financial platform. 
We use their stock market consensus data, comparing with Wall Street Forecasts to build a portfolio strategy to see whether we could generate abnormal returns. 
##Data Source
We obtained the data from Wharton Research Data Services and Estimize.
The Estimize data has 6,657K data points, spanning from 2014 to 2021 with 2000+ companies and 10 industrie, with Estimize EPS Consensus and Wallstreet EPS Consensus for the stocks.
The file final_df in the dataset is the final version of our data we used for our further model building, after cleaning and merging through our raw data.
