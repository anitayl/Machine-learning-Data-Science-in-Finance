This is a Wharton capstone project that cooperates with Estimize, a financial platform. 
We use their stock market consensus data, comparing with Wall Street Forecasts to build a portfolio strategy to see whether we could generate abnormal returns. 
The Estimize data has 6,657K data points, spanning from 2014 to 2021 with 2000+ companies and 10 industries.
